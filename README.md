- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoeDWarner
- 👀 I’m interested in developing new tools for space communication architecture, system development, system analysis. Also, interested in automating system engineering. Some of the systems we are analyzing or have analyzed space internet using RF and Optical links, planetary surface communication and links back to Earth, launch of spacecrafts using laser beams, contigency global or theater communications, and various communication using Near Earth Space networks.
- 🌱 I help oversee people that are developing these tools in various modern languages and Excel. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing techniques that will decrease the time, number of people and level of expertise to do system engineering from concept through reference modeling of different approach to analysis of plugging a new component into an existing external system.
